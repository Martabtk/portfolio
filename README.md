  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Marta Betka, and I hold a Master's degree in [field of study] from Wrocław University of Science and
    Technology. With over 12 years of experience as a quality engineer in a global manufacturing brand, I have developed a
    strong passion for testing and QA engineering. As a quality engineer, I was responsible for conducting tests
    and ensuring the quality of consumer electronics. This experience sparked my interest in software testing for mobile
    and server applications, and I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to deliver reliable and high-performance
    software solutions.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3>CurrencyExchangeRateApp</h3>
  <p>Description: A currency exchange rate tracking and analysis application that utilizes data from the National Bank of
    Poland (NBP). The app allows users to search for currencies, visualize exchange rate trends through charts, calculate
    average rates, and identify maximum and minimum values.</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Martabtk/CurrencyExchangeRateApp.git">GitHub Repository</a></p>

  <p>I have successfully completed various projects as part of my postgraduate studies, including the development of the
    CurrencyExchangeRateApp. This application demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing Python, PySide6, Pandas,
    Matplotlib, and API integration to create a functional and user-friendly software solution. The project involved data
    retrieval from the NBP API, data analysis, chart visualization, and implementing various features to enhance the user
    experience.</p>

  <p>Throughout the development process, I applied my knowledge of software testing techniques to ensure the application's
    quality and reliability. I designed and executed test cases, performed functional and UI testing, and reported and
    resolved any identified issues.</p>
