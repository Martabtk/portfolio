  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Marta Betka. I hold a Master's degree in Faculty of Computer Science and Management from Wrocław University of Science and Technology. I have over 12 years of experience as a quality engineer in a global manufacturing brand, where I was responsible for conducting tests and ensuring the quality of consumer electronics. This experience sparked a strong interest in testing and QA engineering. As a quality engineer, my role involved designing and conducting tests, as well as reporting performance and reliability results for consumer electronics. This experience inspired me to transition into the field of software testing for mobile and server applications. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my knowledge of quality assurance and testing methodologies to deliver reliable and high-performance software solutions.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/Martabtk/CurrencyExchangeRateApp.git">currency_exchange_rate_app</a></h3>
  <p>Description: A currency exchange rate tracking and analysis application that utilizes data from the National Bank of Poland (NBP). The app allows users to search for currencies, visualize exchange rate trends through charts, calculate average rates, and identify maximum and minimum values.</p>
  <p>I have successfully completed various projects as part of my postgraduate studies, including the development of the CurrencyExchangeRateApp. This application demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing Python, PySide6, Pandas, Matplotlib, and API integration to create a functional and user-friendly software solution. The project involved data retrieval from the NBP API, data analysis, chart visualization, and implementing various features to enhance the user experience.</p>
  <p>Throughout the development process, I applied my knowledge of software testing techniques to ensure the application's quality and reliability. I designed and executed test cases, performed functional and UI testing, and reported and resolved any identified issues.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/Martabtk/Pracuj-pl-automated-tests">pracuj_pl_automated_tests</a></h3>
  <p>Description: Automated tests for the Pracuj.pl job portal. The tests utilize Selenium WebDriver and unittest framework to automate various scenarios such as page navigation, form filling, and search functionality. The goal of the project was to create a robust test suite that ensures the stability and functionality of the Pracuj.pl website.</p>
  <p>I developed the Pracuj-pl-automated-tests project to showcase my expertise in test automation using Selenium WebDriver and the unittest framework in Python. The project demonstrates my ability to design and implement automated test cases, handle test data, and generate meaningful test reports. By automating various scenarios on the Pracuj.pl job portal, I aimed to streamline the testing process and improve overall efficiency.</p>
  <p>Throughout the development of the project, I followed best practices in test automation, including maintaining a clear and maintainable code structure, implementing robust error handling, and utilizing effective locators.</p>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Master's degree in Faculty of Computer Science and Management, Wrocław University of Science and Technology</li>
    <li>Postgraduate studies in "Software Testing for Mobile and Server Applications," WSB Merito University, Wrocław</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My postgraduate studies provided a comprehensive curriculum covering a wide range of topics related to software testing. I gained knowledge and practical experience in areas such as test planning, test design techniques, test management tools (JIRA, TestRail). I also learned SQL for database testing, Agile methodologies (SCRUM), and the importance of DevTools in the testing process.</p>

  <p>By combining my educational background and professional experience, I am equipped with the necessary skills and expertise to excel in software testing and QA engineering roles.</p>
